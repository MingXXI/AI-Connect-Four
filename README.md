# AI-Connect-Four

The project include 3 files:

q1                     the excutable program of a5_q1.cpp
use ./q1 to run and have fun.    
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
heuristic             the excutable program of a5_heuristic.cpp
use ./heuristic to run and have fun.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
a5_heuristic.cpp     The solution code for part 2, connect 4 with heuristic.
To test, ./heuristic to run directly 
or use g++ a5_heuristic.cpp to compile and ./a.out to run, follow the text 
instruction and have fun with it. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Report.pdf            The report.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
a5_q1.cpp            The solution code for part 1, connect 4 with pure Monte Carlo tree search.
To test, ./q1 to run directly 
or use g++ a5_q1.cpp to compile and ./a.out to run, follow the text  
instruction and have fun with it.

Note:     if you compile by yourself, you may get warning like 
"warning: in-class initialization of non-static data 
member is a C++11 extension [-Wc++11-extensions]"

you can ignore it and run the file generated or just run the 'q1' and 'heuristic'
I provided.
